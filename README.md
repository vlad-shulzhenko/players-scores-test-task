# Players scores app

I have developed the table of player's scores, which is connected to server and takes data from there.
Used stack: React, TypeScript, Chakra UI, SSE.
- [DEMO LINK](https://vlad-shulzhenko.github.io/players-scores-test-task/)

## Description

Player's scores app includes light and dark themes. Data from the server comes every 3 seconds.
Data does not disappear on page reload, because it stored in sesion storage.
The table is sorted in ascending order by default.You can change the sorting order by clicking `ðŸ •` or `ðŸ —`.
